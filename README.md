# BestSupremeBotOnTheMarket
With this bot you will want to first enter in your information in the placeholder information of Julien Abrams, then you will want to convert it to html and make it into a bookmarklet and then you will be able to check out in one click. Also, it seems as if they have made their captcha service a little bit more stringent so be careful when testing this bot.
The only file that you need to worry about is the 'bot' file. It is written in JavaScript.

The current version of the bot is just a placeholder that worked week 1 but apparently the website has been updated since then. I am currently still working on a bot for this season and once I have proven results that it works it will be posted here.

This bot is a very basic version and I am working on one with an html interface that will hopefully be a lot easier for people to use but it is just not necessary for me so I have not spent that much time on it recently. Also, college just started up so I do not have as much free time as I had last season.
